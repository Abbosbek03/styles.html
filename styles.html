            What is Lorem Ipsum?
        </h1>
        <p>
            Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and <br>
            typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's <br> 
            <hr>
            standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown <br>
             printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a <br>
              type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, <br>
               but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining <br>
                essentially unchanged. <br>

            It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

        <p style="color: blue; text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">
            Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old
